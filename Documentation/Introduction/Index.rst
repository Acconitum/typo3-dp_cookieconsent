What does it do?
================
This Plugin includes the most popular solution to the EU Cookie law JavaScript Plugin `Cookie Consent<https://cookieconsent.insites.com/>`__.
I extended it with Script and iFrame helper, so it works with the ePrivacy law.

Though don't care about the latest EU laws and handle your Cookies with this Plugins.

When is the popup shown to users?
---------------------------------

The popup is shown on every page load until the user saves the consent.
